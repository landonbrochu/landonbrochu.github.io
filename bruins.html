<h1>Boston Bruins</h1>

<p> To be completely honest I'm not a big hockey guy. I grew up playing basketball and there really wasn't a whole lot of hockey in my area so I never really got into it. For that reason I don't really follow the Bruins until the playoffs roll around. Playoff hockey is exciting, that's why I watch it.</p>
