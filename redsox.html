<p>I am so excited for the MLB season to get underway. The Red Sox's spring training opener is against the New York Yankees on February 23rd. The Red Sox are the defending world series champions and are looking to repeat this year. The Sox are expected to be one of the best teams in baseball this year along with the Yankees and Houston Astros. Once it comes down to October baseball we'll see who rises to the top.  </p>
